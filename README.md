# BreadcrumbsLSTM_By_The_AI
* I made basic LSTM model for understand the process of how can we use LSTM model in with our custom dataset.
* I also try it out with Apple Share Stock Market Prediction dataset, yes at very basic level but It clears all the steps.
* I explained steps where there is need to explain and try to make code as simple as possible

1. Basic LSTM
* Notebook: LSTM_Next_Word_Predictor.ipynb

2. Apple Share Stock Market Prediction
* Notebook: Apple_Share_Stock_Market_Prediction_Stacked_LSTM.ipynb
#
* Note: Dataset is within the notebook
* Advise: It is advisable that you follow the sequence as if I explain on thing in previous notebook then in next notebook I directly use it without explaination.
