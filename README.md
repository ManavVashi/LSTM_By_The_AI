# LSTM_By_The_AI
* I made basic LSTM model for understand the process of how can we use the LSTM model with our custom dataset.
* I also tried it out with the Apple Share Stock Market Prediction dataset, yes at very basic level but It clears all the steps.
* I explained steps where there is a need to explain and try to make the code as simple as possible
#
1. Basic LSTM
* Notebook: LSTM_Next_Word_Predictor.ipynb

2. Apple Share Stock Market Prediction
* Notebook: Apple_Share_Stock_Market_Prediction_Stacked_LSTM.ipynb
#
* Note: Dataset is within the notebook
* Advise: You should follow the sequence as if I explain one thing in the previous notebook then in the next notebook I directly use it without explanation.
